The people gather round, each asks a question of the heart, and the man's wisdom is his gift. It is Gibran's gift to us, as well, for Gibran's prophet is rivaled in his wisdom only by the founders of the world's great religions. On the most basic topics--marriage, children, friendship, work, pleasure--his words have a power and lucidity that in another era would surely have provoked the description \"divinely inspired.\" Free of dogma, free of power structures and metaphysics, consider these poetic, moving aphorisms a 20th-century supplement to all sacred traditions--as millions of other readers already have.--Brian Bruya--This text refers to theHardcoveredition."

    "output": "American Baptist pastor, Bible teacher, and writer, Clarence Larkin was born October 28, 1850, in Chester, Delaware County, Pennsylvania. He was converted to Christ at the age of 19 and then felt called to the Gospel ministry, but the doors of opportunity for study and ministry did not open immediately. He then got a job in a bank. When he was 21 years old, he left the bank and went to college, graduating as a mechanical engineer. He continued as a professional draftsman for a while, then he became a teacher of the blind. Later, failing health compelled him to give up his teaching career. After a prolonged rest, he became a manufacturer. When he was converted he had become a member of the Episcopal Church, but in 1882,he became a Baptist and was ordained as a Baptist minister two years later. He went directly from business into the ministry. His first charge was at Kennett Square, Pennsylvania; his second pastorate was at Fox Chase, Pennsylvania, where he remained for 20 years. He was not a premillennialist at the time of his ordination, but his study of the Scriptures, with the help of some books that fell into his hands, led him to adopt the premillennialist position. He began to make large wall charts, which he titled, \"\"Prophetic Truth,\"\" for use in the pulpit. These led to his being invited to teach, in connection with his pastoral work, in two Bible institutes. During this time he published a number of prophetical charts, which were widely circulated. When World War I broke out in 1914, he was called on for addresses on The War and Prophecy. Then God laid it on his heart to prepare a work on Dispensational Truth (or God's Plan and Purpose in the Ages), containing a number of charts with descriptive matter. He spent three years of his life designing and drawing the charts and preparing the text. The favorable reception it has had since it was first published in 1918 seems to indicate that the world was waiting for such a book. Because it had a large and wide circulation in this and other lands, the first edition was soon exhausted. It was followed by a second edition, and then, realizing that the book was of permanent value, Larkin revised it and expanded it, printing it in its present form. He went to be with the Lord on January 24, 1924.\"--This text refers to thePaperbackedition."

In short chapters he aims his microscope at such highly touted foods as tomatoes, acai berries, curry and soy; additives like nitrites, artificial sweeteners, vitamins and fluoride; contaminants including pesticides, hormones, trans fats and dioxins; and what, for him, are suspect fads. Schwarcz contends that while there are no magical foods, a diet of mostly vegetables, fruits, whole grains and low-fat dairy products and moderation are key to good health. To help readers make informed choices, he ably cuts through many controversies and will likely stir up a few (he challenges those who condemn milk consumption, espouse detoxification and promote kosher foods, for example). Schwarcz makes learning fun by peppering his text with fascinating facts (coffee contains naturally occurring carcinogens, and apples have formaldehyde). More importantly, he leaves readers with a rational framework for evaluating the complex nature of foods and how they affect health.(Jan.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The latest in the publisher's series of regional cookbooks (others on Italy, China and Asia have preceded it), it will keep readers turning pages even if they never pick up a saucepan. Chapters alternate between discussing the different regions of France and offering a good selection of traditional recipes. French-born authors and cooks Marianne Comolli, Elisabeth Scotto and Michele Carles reflect on the history and geography of France with appetizers from Provence, entrees from Lyonnais and desserts from Anjou. This is hearty, not haute , cuisine: well-organized recipes are scaled for the average cook, who won't have to go in search of rare ingredients or spend hours chopping and mincing.

The photos show us villages and farms and take us into homes, schools and factories. From a kaleidoscope of images--rice-planting brigades, a defendant in the dock on trial for murder, yaks on Main Street in one city--we get a feel for the contradictions and pressures of a modernizing society. Many of the photos are exceptionally beautiful; taken together, they reveal the diversity of this vast country, moving from the tent-like yurts of Mongolian nomads to a Tantric Buddhist monastery in occupied Tibet. The photo-essay concludes with a glimpse of protest posters that went up at Beijing University as students began to occupy Tiananmen Square, a tragically ironic conclusion in light of events that followed.

Cronin's achievement in this scintillating, highly enjoyable social and cultural history is to demonstrate how the various endeavors of these and other groundbreakers were interrelated. France's adaptation to unless France really developed it.aa the motor car changed Proust's way of life. A new subjectivism, spurred by Bergson's spiritual philosophy, made possible Debussy's exploration of musical nuance, Picasso and Braque's invention of Cubism, and poet Charles Peguy's vision of a socialist utopia. Mingling gossip, biography and astute commentary, this chronicle tracks Diaghilev, Colette, Mattise and a host of others. Cronin, biographer of Napoleon, argues persuasively that Parisians' chilly rancor toward Germans stemmed in part from France's sense of national pride.

Thesiger remembers Addis Ababa, the capital, as a village with grass huts, no roads and colorful ceremonies. He attended Eton and Oxford, then returned to Africa for the first of many journeys, exploring the Awash River (home to the dreaded Danakil, whose warriors killed randomly to prove their manhood and collected their victims' genitals for trophies). As a district officer in the Sudan Political Service, Thesiger had further opportunities to travel in desert lands and meet nomadic tribes. During World War II, he served with Orde Wingate's troops, liberating Abyssinia from the Italians; later, he fought behind the lines in the Western Desert. In addition to superb adventure, Thesiger gives a fine portrait of the waning days of the British Empire in the Sudan and of the last revolution in Ethiopia.

Canada, for coverage of so vast a territory, engaged 100 international photographers (to Israelis ' mostly native 55), to produce 100,000 images (to Israelis ' 40,000), from which its several hundred memorable black-and-white and color illustrations were chosen. The photos juxtapose the industrial to the rural. A lively essay recounts experiences organizing the project and photographing on the actual day (June 8, 1984). The photographers get credit next to their pictures; a map shows where each worked that day; and a lengthy section gives their respective backgrounds, illustrated with past work. Israelis seems earnest, even somber, in comparison. With more than 300 equally fine images, it plays down the individual artists, presenting only a list of credits at the end. The introduction discusses not so much this project as the past and present social and political developments in this young nation, placing the images firmly in context. And indeed, throughout the coverage of agriculture, sheep, beaches, and apartment houses are the ubiquitous soldiers with guns. The heat and aridity are everywhere evident on this day (May 10, 1984) in the ``green'' month, before things are parched to brown. Both books use a chronological arrangement and tell when, to the hour, the pictures were taken, but Canada , being so large, offers maps on each page to show the geographical location of particular images.

Only the Bible and works by Shakespeare have outdistanced her. Problems at Pollensa Bay & Other Stories provides a delightful addition to this vast body of writing by \"the mistress of mystery.\" Though these eight stories are not new, several are less well known, and this audiobook represents an exciting renewal of one of the world's most popular authors. \"The Harlequin Tea Set,\" thought to be Dame Agatha's last short story, is a tale of mistaken identity and features Mr. Saterthwaite and Harley Quin, who also appear together in \"The Love Detectives,\" a little-known story about a messy love triangle. Mr. Parker Pyne, Christie's goverment statistician turned detective, is called upon to save a love-struck young man in the title story. Also included is a mystery involving the eccentric and slightly pompous Hercule Poirot. The audiobook is narrated by Jonathan Cecil, whose superb vocal adaptations greatly enhance Dame Agatha's work. This is an excellent production, highly entertaining, and a most worthwhile purchase for any library.?Gretchen Browne, Rockville Centre P.L.,Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."

As glimpsed through the fine nostalgic mist of Jones's camera, the root swells a Mediterranean fish stew; stuffs golden fowl or green chilies; or lies au naturel , pending baking or roasting. Among the most appealing recipes are the simplest: in roasted balsamic potatoes and onions, recommended as an accompaniment to red meats, the contenders are oven-roasted first in olive oil and then in seasoned balsamic vinegar; in rosemary potato skewers, potato chunks are boiled, dredged in herbs and spices, and grilled on charcoal. But if the potato lends itself to these visceral pleasures, it can also sneak into upper-crust tarts without suffering. (And even into hummus--where, one suspects, it may languish.) Waldron, trained at La Varenne, offers appetizers, side dishes and main courses in her brief book, a new entry in Collins's attractive Country Garden Cookbook series, and even offers advice to the amateur grower--but omits desserts, where potatoes can give depth and moist substance, if not pungence, to tortes.

You'll feel more than that after browsing through this nostalgia-soaked photo-biography. Combining wonderful vintage photographs with a brief autobiographical narrative from Roy himself, the book chronicles the storybook life of one Leonard Slye, a Depression-era teenager when his family left their Ohio farm for a dust-bowl journey to California. Only a few short years later, Leonard had become Roy Rogers, \"King of the Cowboys,\" and was launched on a career that would encompass 81 movies, a TV series, and hundreds of radio performances and recordings. The success of Roy Rogers says a lot about the U.S. during the Depression and throughout World War II, but it says even more about the wide eyes of kids everywhere at anytime.

As such, Southwest can be read as a gastronomic travel book, filled with escapist textures and tastes. The book is organized by locale (e.g., the Rio Grande Basin gets one chapter) and by genre (desserts and beverages; soups, stews and chilis). It's both picturesque and practical: Kolpas sets the scene well for upscale-indigenous meals with his surveys of Southwest history and habits, while Fenzl offers practical and appealing recipes (especially for salsas and the like, and for appetizers).

Gaining and losing vast fortunes; making shrewd, status-enhancing marriages; and jockeying for social and political power are the recurring themes of this family saga, whose subjects rose from being wealthy farmers during the reign of Henry VII to ranking among the most prosperous and prominent families in the land by the 18th century, only to see both their wealth and their status decline throughout the Victorian and contemporary eras--until Diana, third daughter of the eighth earl, made her \"fairy-tale\" marriage into the royal family. Including such notables as Sarah Churchill and the infamous 18th-century duchess of Marlborough, whose carefully calculated scheming made the family one of the richest in the land, the Spencer clan is replete with colorful characters. That Princess Diana herself drew strength from this ancestral heritage, as Pearson claims, is undoubtable; more dubious, however, are his repeated assertions that various facets of Diana's own character are direct inheritances from one ancestor or another. This suggestion that biology is destiny culminates in the proposition--based on the observation that Princes William and Harry look more like their mother than their father--that the Spencer genes have superseded those of the Windsors and will be instrumental in shaping the future of the British monarchy. While this claim that the Spencer family history yields vital insights into the destinies of Diana and her children seems somewhat overstated, those who admire the late princess of Wales and those who are drawn to accounts of English dynastic history will find the story of the Spencers engrossing.

Readers seeking an armchair tour of the region, singularly depicted, and the chance to see and reproduce its dishes, will delight in the book, which would also make a welcome gift.Beginning with an introduction to the land and its cooking, the book then weaves short essays about the Proven&#xE7;al regions with recipes arranged by courses. There are exemplary versions of bouillabaisse and bourride (the creamy, garlic-infused fish chowder), estouffade (braised beef, here with olives and mushrooms), daubs (stews), vegetable-filled omelets, and tians (savory gratins). Less familiar treasures include a mixed herb pasta from Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, porgy with crab sauce from the Var, a braised stuffed lamb shoulder from Vaucluse, zucchini and rice gratin from the Alpes Maritimes, and dried figs in thyme and red wine syrup, also from the Var. The recipes reflect Olney's unerring palate and dedication to tradition; some cooks may find certain dishes beyond their reach, but all will discover approachable recipes that are easily made.

The celebrated Belgian sleuth visits the sleepy English village of Warmsley Vale to check into the background of Gordon Cloade, supposedly a victim of the London Blitz. He had wed an attractive young widow, the former Mrs. Underhay, now the sole possessor of the Cloade family fortune. The deceased's sister-in-law told Poirot that \"spirits\" informed her that the widow's first husband is still among the living, raising suspicions about Cloade's demise. Fraser's tone at once reassures listeners that, just as on television, they are in capable hands. He does a fine job creating a variety of character voices, distinguishing one from another with clarity but without excessive flamboyance.

    "output": "Long neglected, antique roses with their extravagantly blowzy flowers, quite unlike the tight-petaled blooms of their modern cousins, hybrid teas, are deservedly enjoying renewed popularity. These two titles by British rosarians are evidence of this trend. Scarman, owner of an English nursery that specializes in old-fashioned varieties, presents a beautifully illustrated directory of 150 roses as well as chapters on plant design, companion planting (with examples of innovative combinations), and basic care. Although Beales, a commercial rose grower and daughter of renowned old-rose specialist Peter Beales, intended her Rose Basics as a general guide to growing all types of roses, she features many heirloom roses worthy of cultivation. Particularly useful is the chapter on roses for difficult conditions, such as shade and poor soil; such information is often neglected in basic rose culture guides. Because both of these titles were written for a British audience, they lack specific critical advice for American gardeners, i.e., appropriate rose selection and care for the highly diverse climatic regions of the United States. For such information, readers should turn to Rayford Reddell's A Year in the Life of a Rose: A Guide to Growing Roses from Coast to Coast (LJ 11/15/96) or Judith McKeon's Encyclopedia of Roses: An Organic Guide to Growing America's Favorite Flower (LJ 9/1/95).

Germany  challenged the Royal Navy's global dominance, the U.S. and Japan  established themselves as major naval powers. The revolutionaryHMS  Dreadnoughtwas succeeded by even larger and more powerful warships  that clashed spectacularly at the battle of Jutland in 1916. Plans for  a new generation of &#39;super dreadnoughts&#39; were delayed by  international treaties, but Japanese ambitions eventually led to a new  arms race with the U.S.. This naval race produced the world&#39;s  largest and most heavily-armed battleships, like theYamotoandOwa. Combat experience in World War II soon revealed that  submarines and aircraft posed a lethal threat to even the greatest  battleship. Only the U.S. Navy had the resources to maintain a  battleship force after 1945, and these mighty warships have attached  enemy coasts from Vietnam and the Lebanon to the 1991 Gulf War.Acclaimed naval illustrator Tony Gibbons has painted all classes of  twentieth century battleship forJane&#39;s Battleships of the 20th  Century. Every major battleship is shown in profile, with the 25  greatest battleships illustrated across the full width of the page,  with accompanying plan and bow views.Naval historian Bernard  Ireland reveals the fascinating background to each class of battleship.

It provides an empirical and a conceptual basis for the idea of relational spirituality, an understanding that is not only of great practical interest to teachers, clergy and parents, but creates the groundwork for a prophetic protest against forces in the modern world that would undermine the natural spirituality of human beings. It is not only refreshingly clear in an area often somewhat confused, but offers original insights into the lives and attitudes of young children.' - John M Hull is Professor of Practical Theology in the Queen's Foundation for Ecumenical Theological Education in Birmingham and Emeritus Professor of Religious Education at the University of Birmingham, England. 'The Spirit of the Child...is currently the seminal book on children's spirituality on the international scene.' - Christian Education Journal 'Very, very impressive.' - Professor Andrew Greeley, University of Chicago [One of best known sociologists of religion in the world, with a US nationally syndicated newspaper column on religion.] 'For many people, this was a ground-breaking research study...many, perhaps most, subsequent research studies made use of their definitions of spirituality and the broad perspective of spirituality that encompasses all children everywhere.' - Professor Don Ratcliff, Toccoa Falls College 'David Hay and Rebecca Nye have done outstanding research in this difficult, yet most important area. Almost all children are born with a spiritual potential, but how are we to recognize its specificity in a given case and how to foster its development - rather than to let it wither away or even corrupt it unwittingly? Reading this volume will help all involved to understand these issues more deeply, and to contribute more to the blossoming of a child's spirituality.' - Professor K. Helmut Reich, School of Consciousness Studies and Sacred Values, Rutherford University 'It is difficult not to be beguiled by Hay's analysis. What might be called its seamless holisticity, its concern to wed the spiritual to practical and altruistic purpose, and its lack of religious dogmatism (despite Hay's professed Roman Catholic affiliation) provide a sophisticated argument for educational and social purposiveness.' - Clive Erricker, Editor, International Journal of Children's Spirituality 'I have just re-read The Spirit of the Child after seven years. It was recently used in a course I taught at General Theological Seminary in New York City. The book is still as fresh and exciting today as it was seven years ago. You cannot ask for a better team of writers to produce such a volume. I have admired David Hay's work since his days at the Alister Hardy Research Centre at Manchester College, Oxford and his wonderful book, Exploring Inner Space. Dr. Hay is a biologist and experienced researcher in this field as well as an insightful commentator who sets the stage for the research described in The Spirit of the Child. He also contributes to the research, and then follows up with some practices that might be used to help children develop spiritually. Dr. Nye, a child psychologist attached to The Divinity School at Cambridge University, is a gifted and insightful researcher with an informed ability and deep intuition for knowing and being with children.

Why do people continually hide their real selves from the people around them? Why are so many so insecure and afraid to open up? The answer, explains John Powell, is that maturity is reached by communicating and interacting with others. This book considers the consequences our real self faces if no one else ever finds out what we are like.  In this enduring classic, the companion to Why Am I Afraid to Love?, John Powell explains how to be more emotionally open, and shows how people adopt roles and play psychological games to protect their inner selves. The courage to be our real selves can be developed, and then we can begin to grow.  Now newly designed for a fresh audience, Why Am I Afraid to Tell You Who I Am? is as relevant as it has been for twenty years. With a proven track record, it continues to speak to the needs and aspirations of people today. It is best included in self help sections of general bookshops, but also has a religious appeal."

We are also introduced to some air squadrons from both sides and their marvelous dogfights. In one tactile scene, a pilot rolls his craft and banks sharply to avoid flak; he \"browns out\" and then finds himself far over the desert, momentarily quite lost. Nonetheless, Schramm and Lampard steal the show, chasing each other, cracking jokes--they are really quite alike, and, seen through their eyes, war is a grim but also a joyous affair. Even the plague of flies that follows these sweating men every step of the way can seem amusing: \"If they followed Lampard rather more faithfully it was not because he was the officer but because he was six foot two and there was more of him to overheat.\" Robinson is extremely funny, actually, and subtle, which lifts his writing out of the genre; even so, he's not much interested in causes or in the meaninglessness of war. Of course it's meaningless, he might say. He wants to focus on young men in a great adventure, risking their lives and loving it, playing deadly games with complicated, deadly machinery. \"Men are always killing themselves to prove their manhood,\" says a woman at Paul Schramm's funeral.

Their maneuverings spark a complicated plot whose many ramifications include a charitable organization that doubles as a clearinghouse for those seeking to fake their own deaths and the set-up of a tax-free Peruvian corporation through the use of bearer shares, but Murphy keeps all the craziness in perspective with a first-person narration that unfolds as a series of quiet, subtle surprises.

Unfortunately, the novel has few merits of its own to set against those authors' works. Hero Alex Cross is in fact a black senior detective in Washington, D.C., who is also a psychiatrist and has a facile but not entirely convincing line of sentimental-cynical patter. The villain is Gary Soneji/Murphy (read Hyde/Jekyll), who kills for recognition, and finally kidnaps the kids of prominent parents. Alex is soon on the case, more enraged by Gary's killing of poor ghetto blacks than by the Lindbergh-inspired kidnapping, and becomes involved with a gorgeous, motorcycle-riding Secret Service supervisor who is not what she seems.

    "output": "Veteran horror writer James Herbert brings back the protagonist ofHauntedto  investigate psychic disturbances in a picturesque village in the Lake District of England. It's an interesting mishmash of a novel--not entirely successful, but enjoyable all the same. Herbert's penchant for gorgeously visceral carnage unfortunately clashes with his equally skilled ability to create a subtle mood of supernatural terror. And he throws way too many ingredients into the stew: family secrets, rape, infanticide, necrophilia, the &quot;Black Arts,&quot; a moldering mansion, a sinister yellow fog, drowning children, poltergeist pranks, a haunted painting, a tormented vicar, a neglectful doctor, even an evil knight. Yet, asNecrofile: The Review of Horror Fictionreports, &quot;None of these  flaws are fatal.

Under hypnosis, she relives the final, tortured moments in the life of Matilda, a 12th century Welshwoman. In the process, Jo herself comes close to death. The story then jumps 15 years. Jo, now a journalist researching regression, is again hypnotized and again regresses to Matilda's excitement-packed life. Unfortunately, the pace of the early pages is not maintained. The problem is not with Jo/Matilda, who are both well-drawn, or even with the whopping coincidences Jo encounters. What slows the narrative is the bevy of minor characters, Jo's acquaintances. They talk to her and about her, they try to help her and they conspire against her, all at the expense of the central plotline. This is still a good read, but it could have been better.

Amiss doesn't quite approve of hunting, but that doesn't deter Troutbeck: \"Bugger your moral susceptibilities,\" she orders, and he does. While the opposition counts among its supporters the likes of Brother Francis (Lord Purseglove), whose vapid nature poetry would embarrass a bunny rabbit, Troutbeck's allies include a couple of boorish lords who must be controlled, while the Rights of Animals League proves a formidable foe. Troutbeck is great fun?a woman of large and lusty appetites who demolishes arguments or a glass of whisky with equal gusto. Amiss is swept along in her wake as the war of words and wits turns to a murderous assault in the House of Lords that leaves several members dead and others shaken.

Still mourning the death of her lover, Richard, Kate is hired by two \"barely comprehensible Glaswegian musicians\" to find out who is trashing their band's reputation by sending goons to break up their shows. She hasn't time to troll Manchester's music scene before friends complicate things by dropping bombshells. First, her business partner announces he's selling his share of the shop and moving to Australia; unfortunately, Kate lacks the funds to buy him out. Then her best friend, Alexis, says that she and her pregnant lover, Christine, need help. The gynecologist who, as Alexis puts it, \"worked with us\" on the pregnancy has been murdered, and Alexis believes that if Kate doesn't steal the relevant medical files they'll lose the baby. And that's if Kate can figure out who the doctor is: Alexis knows her as Helen Maitland, but the newspapers call her Sarah Blackstone. By the time Kate figures out who stabbed the mysterious doctor, she has forgotten why she's looking. But as Kate cruises along, whether setting up a trap with her chum DCI Della Prentice or cutting a deal with the \"Godfather of Manchester\" (who has a fake Italian accent), readers will happily keep up, even if it leaves them a little breathless.

After Grace dies, Neville marries socialite Dido Tallent, but when their first child dies at birth, his faith in both God and his own motives is rocked. In crisis, Neville asks his colleague Jon Darrow (narrator of Glamorous Powers ) for spiritual first aid and, guided by a wise abbot friend of Jon's, is forced to an honest appraisal of himself and his ambition--which has its roots in his early life. He struggles back to spiritual health and eventually emerges a wiser man, more honest and loving toward his family and his flock. This is the third in Howatch's incomparable series about the Church of England in the 20th century; it's a measure of her achievement that, besides telling a fascinating story boldly and well, she illuminates often quite abstruse religious and ecclesiastical questions.

Her debut novel is an unpretentious gem of a book that charts the late coming-of-age of Miss Julia Garnet, a retired English schoolteacher who spends six months in Venice after her lifelong companion, Harriet, dies. Venice has a magical effect on reserved Julia: a dyed-in-the-wool Communist, she relaxes in her antipathy toward religion, and even begins to visit the local church. There, she becomes enamored of a series of paintings that tell the story of the Apocryphal book of Tobit, a tale that mixes elements of Judaism with the religion of Zoroaster. In the story, young Tobias travels to Medea, part of the Persian Empire, to collect a debt for his father, blind Tobit. He is accompanied on his journey by a hired guide who turns out to be the Angel Raphael. As Julia learns more about Tobias's trek, she embarks upon a soul-altering journey of her own. She falls in love with an art dealer, Carlo, and befriends Sarah and Toby, twins working on the restoration of a Venetian chapel. When Toby disappears suddenly, after discovering a priceless Renaissance painting, Julia finds out that neither Carlo nor the twins are exactly what they seem--but that the Angel Raphael's watchful spirit will help good prevail.

Anne, her sister Mary and their brother George are all brought to the king's court at a young age, as players in their uncle's plans to advance the family's fortunes. Mary, the sweet, blond sister, wins King Henry VIII's favor when she is barely 14 and already married to one of his courtiers. Their affair lasts several years, and she gives Henry a daughter and a son. But her dark, clever, scheming sister, Anne, insinuates herself into Henry's graces, styling herself as his adviser and confidant. Soon she displaces Mary as his lover and begins her machinations to rid him of his wife, Katherine of Aragon. This is only the beginning of the intrigue that Gregory so handily chronicles, capturing beautifully the mingled hate and nearly incestuous love Anne, Mary and George (\"kin and enemies all at once\") feel for each other and the toll their family's ambition takes on them. Mary, the story's narrator, is the most sympathetic of the siblings, but even she is twisted by the demands of power and status; charming George, an able plotter, finally brings disaster on his own head by falling in love with a male courtier. Anne, most tormented of all, is ruthless in her drive to become queen, and then to give Henry a male heir. Rather than settling for a picturesque rendering of court life, Gregory conveys its claustrophobic, all-consuming nature with consummate skill. In the end, Anne's famous, tragic end is offset by Mary's happier fate, but the self-defeating folly of the quest for power lingers longest in the reader's mind.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an alternatePaperbackedition."

When young Lord Hugo and his men burn the abbey to the ground during a drunken rampage, Alys is the only one to escape; she flees back to Morach, consumed with guilt at having abandoned her dying sisters. Summoned to minister to Lord Hugh, Hugo's father, Alys soon finds herself deeply involved in the treachery and intrigue surrounding the old man's attempts to have his son's marriage to the barren Lady Catherine annulled. Attracted to Hugo despite his murderous past, Alys begins to practice witchcraft in earnest to rid him of Catherine and become his wife. Her spells work all too well: Catherine's long-awaited pregnancy ends disastrously, and Hugo comes to love Alys, but in a sickly haze of lust that provides no basis for marriage. Alys soon finds herself so sunk in evil, so removed from God's love, that only a truly shocking gesture can bring about her salvation.

Since his forte, \"the long kill\" with the aid of a telescopic lens, is becoming impossible due to his failing eyesight, he phones in his resignation to the man he knows as Jacob in London. Later, the ex-gunman buys a cottage and meets a young widow, Anya Wilson, her small son and her father, whom Jaysmith recognizes as Bryant. The future seems bright for Jaysmith as he and Anya plan marriage, but Jacob suddenly materializes with armed hirelings to dispose of Steven and Anya. Alerted to a conspiracy, Jaysmith braves overwhelming odds in the shoot-out that caps the novel's shocking disclosure. This taut thriller is a tour de force enhanced by the author's evocations of the English countryside's natural splendor.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."

This account presents edited portions of journal entries written during trips to remote mountain areas of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Kurdistan between 1952 and 1965, as well as numerous black-and-white photographs that he took at the time. Some of these areas are more developed today than they were half a century ago, while others are even more inaccessible owing to political upheavals. Thesiger's writing is sparse, as would be expected from diary entries, and consequently may disappoint those looking for more detail or seeking current travel information. Those wanting to know more about Thesiger's remarkable life should read his autobiography, The Life of My Choice (LJ 3/15/98), which ought to be an essential purchase even for small public libraries.

    "output": "Any talk ofThe Namesake--Jhumpa Lahiri's follow-up to her Pulitzer Prize-winning debut,Interpreter of Maladies--must begin with a name: Gogol Ganguli. Born to an Indian academic and his wife, Gogol is afflicted from birth with a name that is neither Indian nor American nor even really a first name at all. He is given the name by his father who, before he came to America to study at MIT, was almost killed in a train wreck in India. Rescuers caught sight of the volume of Nikolai Gogol's short stories that he held, and hauled him from the train. Ashoke gives his American-born son the name as a kind of placeholder, and the awkward thing sticks.Awkwardness is Gogol's birthright. He grows up a bright American boy, goes to Yale, has pretty girlfriends, becomes a successful architect, but like many second-generation immigrants, he can never quite find his place in the world. There's a lovely section where he dates a wealthy, cultured young Manhattan woman who lives with her charming parents. They fold Gogol into their easy, elegant life, but even here he can find no peace and he breaks off the relationship.  His mother finally sets him up on a blind date with the daughter of a Bengali friend, and Gogol thinks he has found his match. Moushumi, like Gogol, is at odds with the Indian-American world she inhabits. She has found, however, a circuitous escape: \"At Brown, her rebellion had been academic ... she'd pursued a double major in French. Immersing herself in a third language, a third culture, had been her refuge--she approached French, unlike things American or Indian, without guilt, or misgiving, or expectation of any kind.\" Lahiri documents these quiet rebellions and random longings with great sensitivity. There's no  cleverness or showing-off inThe Namesake, just beautifully confident storytelling. Gogol's story is neither comedy nor tragedy; it's simply that ordinary, hard-to-get-down-on-paper commodity: real life.--Claire Dederer--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."

Paddington is, understandably, a favorite character for kids, one they can truly relate to, as his best-laid, well-intentioned plans somehow go topsy-turvy. As always, Bond's prose is fun to read, with the solemn, serious Paddington providing humorous contrast to the absurd goings-on around him.

This book's action begins in mid-flight during a  winter gale, with Arithon fleeing the walled city Jaelot, where  he's been imprisoned. With him he drags the unwilling peasant  Fionn Areth Caid'an, magically raised as his double to trap him.  Soon they join forces with Dakar the Mad Prophet (whose  prophecies have an erratic track record, though some have been  important), assigned by the Fellowship of Sorcerers to defend  our protagonist. Dakar has supplies and horses ready. Much  geography is traversed with many turgid pages spent attempting  to describe the indescribable effects of magic. Occasionally the  focus moves to Lysaer, with his large retinue of soldiers and  fanatic priests, who in private practice rituals as sorcerous as  the techniques of which they accuse Arithon.

Lonely and neglected by his parents, he rescues an abandoned white lion cub and cares for it, gradually forming a close bond. After some years the boy's parents abruptly decide to send him to school in England and sell the lion. Bertie attempts to save the animal by returning it to the jungle, but it has lost its ability to survive in the wild and returns to the only home it has known. A French circus owner buys the lion, and the boy vows never to forget him. Twelve years later, Bertie fights in World War I and is decorated for rescuing wounded comrades. In a small French town he finally finds his lion, starving and near death, and the two friends are reunited. Heartened by the woman's tale, the student returns to school. This touching story is well written and emotionally satisfying. Readers will be drawn to this fascinating tale of a unique friendship between boy and beast.

As a youngster, Antonito lived on a small farm outside the village of Sauceda. His father raised strong black bulls for the bullring, or corrida. The boy bonded with a newborn calf after its mother died, and in order to save it, he led Paco into the surrounding hills. While they were away, Franco's soldiers bombed the village. Leaving Paco behind, Antonito returned home, discovering the farm in flames. He escaped back into the safety of the countryside, but couldn't find the calf. Weeks later, suffering from hunger and exhaustion, he was found by his Uncle Juan, a Republican soldier, and nursed back to health. While recuperating, he heard a tale of a large black bull that chased down Nationalist soldiers, and he hoped that it was Paco. Years later, after he dreamed that the creature rested next to him while he slept in the forest, he awakened to discover hoof marks of a massive bull in the still-warm grass. Morpurgo's action-filled novel packs an emotional punch. The author gradually reveals the historical information and narrates the tale with the careful detachment of someone relating a story so awful that he can hardly bear to tell it.

At 52, with three suicide attempts, extended hospitalizations, the death of her husband and daughter, and a vicious attack behind her, Rae has come to Folly Island, far out in the Straits of Juan de Fuca, to rebuild her life by building a house:She would pull herself together, she would go and rebuild Desmond's house, she would lift his walls and dwell within them quietly all the rest of her days.  Everything that House was lay there waiting for her to take it up: House as shelter, House as permanence, House as a continuation and a legacy, comfort and challenge, safety and beauty, symbol and reality joined as one.Bequeathed to Rae by Desmond Newborn, a great-uncle she never met, Folly Island is lovely indeed.  But when Rae discovers Desmond's journal in the 70-year-old ruins of his house, she learns that Desmond had his own internal horrors to confront on the island.  As she labors in solitude, her prickly nature deterring all but the most determined of her would-be neighbors, it's not just her well-being that's at stake.  Rae must prove herself sane if she is to have any contact with her beloved granddaughter Petra. So when the \"skin-crawling feeling of being watched\" doesn't fade, she does her best to ignore it. But does paranoia have its roots in reality? And is Rae doomed to repeat her ancestor's tragic end?So effectively does King weave together past and present--the shrouded history of Desmond's life and death on Folly, and the tense, dusty, exhilaratingly panicky account of Rae's wrestling with old demons and new timber--that the future seems less important than the author might have wished.  In other words, the eventual unmasking of Rae's watcher pales in comparison to the gradual revelation of Rae herself within King's haunted and haunting narrative. But with such a strong character and such moodily lovely prose, readers shouldn't miss the denouement-driven trappings of standard suspense.--Kelly Flynn--This text refers to theHardcoveredition."

    "output": "Describing itself as \"A Hip Guide to Modern Witchcraft,\" this uninhibited offering from Australian witch, rock diva, model and media personality Horne is pure pop entertainment, reading more like a feature in a fashion magazine than an account of the present-day practice of Wicca. Steeped in girlfriend-to-girlfriend attitude and style, Horne's funky and relentlessly positive prose (\"[Eve] was, in fact, a benevolent and switched-on sister....\") is liable to infuriate practiced occultists while proving irresistible to young people fascinated by or even just curious about witchcraft. Part memoir and part manual, the book offers snapshots of just about every part of a modern witch's practice, from casting spells and observing Wiccan sabbaths to setting up an altar and practicing \"skyclad\" (or nude)Anot to mention how to make magic with, for and during sex. Although this guidebook can safely be characterized as a lighthearted romp through the practice of witchcraft, it does contain some useful and well-organized reference material, such as a glossary of \"magickal\" herbs, a calendar of the witch's year and a full complement of easy-to-follow spells for love, money and so forth. Occasionally, ethical qualms silence Horne's ready tongue, leading to curiously unusable directives (as in \"Bitchcraft,\" the chapter on hexing, where she describes in graphic detail the preparation and abuse of an enemy's effigy, but primly refuses to tell you what to say while you're doing it). Experienced Wiccans and occultists will want to turn to more authoritative sources, but as it stands, this is an appealing introduction for the dabbler, the dreamer and other wide-eyed seekers of modern-day magic. (Jan.) Forecast: From the sexy photo of Horne on its jacket to its overall pop approach and its unusually low price (especially for a hardcover containing color photos), this title promises to be the witchcraft book of 2001. Thorsons is backing it with a three-city author tour and a 60,000 print run. Expect the book to cast a spell on readers, resulting in charmed sales.Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc."

Using a plot formula that has since become a mystery standard, Christie conveniently gathers all the characters in one hard-to-leave location, in this case, the Jolly Roger, a vacation hotel on the southern coast of England. One of the guests, a gorgeous, dramatic flirt, is strangled to death, and the famous detective Hercule Poirot who happens to be vacationing at the Jolly Roger, too sets out to solve the case. Each of the well-developed characters is suspect, and listeners will constantly be changing their bets as to whodunit. British stage actor Suchet, who many know as the definitive Poirot from the Public Television Mystery! series was an obvious choice for the reader of this production, having won an Audie award for reading Christie's Mysterious Affair at Styles in 1997. Suchet gives an outstanding and highly entertaining performance, obviously taking great zeal in the task of fleshing out Christie's colorful lot of characters.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."

Her instructions are practical, too: if mace, cedar and nutmeg are hard to come by, burn lavender incense; if chanting \"skyclad\" (read: naked) doesn't appeal, wear a white flowing robe. This simplicity and pragmatism is especially important in light of Horne's personal theology, which with its elements of Hinduism, Greek mythology, astrology, Native American ritual and Hazelden self-help books is extremely ecumenical. Readers eager to explore the latest developments in self-improvement trends might find helpful mantras within and will likely be delighted by Horne's enthusiasm for her subject. It would take some real magic to convince the skeptics, however; but if anyone can do that, it's this mediagenic author.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc."

Tolkien's definitive three-book epic, the Lord of the Rings (encompassingThe Fellowship of the Ring,The Two Towers, andThe Return of the King), and its charming precursor,The Hobbit. That many (if not most) fantasy works are in some way derivative of Tolkien is understood, but the influence of the Lord of the Rings is so universal that everybody from George Lucas to Led Zeppelin has appropriated it for one purpose or another.Not just revolutionary because it was groundbreaking, the Lord of the Rings is timeless because it's the product of a truly top-shelf mind. Tolkien was a distinguished linguist and Oxford scholar of dead languages, with strong ideas about the importance of myth and story and a deep appreciation of nature. His epic, 10 years in the making, recounts the Great War of the Ring and the closing of Middle-Earth's Third Age, a time when magic begins to fade from the world and men rise to dominance. Tolkien carefully details this transition with tremendous skill and love, creating in the Lord of the Rings a universal and all-embracing tale, a justly celebrated classic.--Paul Hughes--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."

Only his second collection (the first wasDark Carnival, later reworked intoThe October Country), it is a marvelous, if mostly dark, quilt of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. In an ingenious framework to open and close the book, Bradbury presents himself as a nameless narrator who meets the Illustrated Man--a wanderer whose entire body is a living canvas of exotic tattoos. What's even more remarkable, and increasingly disturbing, is that the illustrations are themselves magically alive, and each proceeds to unfold its own story, such as \"The Veldt,\" wherein rowdy children take a game of virtual reality way over the edge. Or \"Kaleidoscope,\" a heartbreaking portrait of stranded astronauts about to reenter our atmosphere--without the benefit of a spaceship. Or \"Zero Hour,\" in which invading aliens have discovered a most logical ally--our own children. Even though most were written in the 1940s and 1950s, these 18 classic stories will be just as chillingly effective 50 years from now.--Stanley Wiater--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."

Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind remains the blueprint for the genre, while Tolstoy's War and Peace carries off the literary honours ... it's quickly apparent that the Russian-born author Paullina Simons has the measure of this kind of epic romantic saga. The power of her descriptive writing, the vividness of the historical detail and, most of all, the strength of her central characters mark out her novel as a considerable achievement ... she is able to make some powerful statements about the durability of the human spirit, but never at the expense of descriptive passages refulgent with power and beauty' Barry Forshaw, amazon"

In this audiobook, narrator Bamji accomplishes that task with skill, credibly rendering the lilting flavor of subcontinental English and reveling in the musicality of Ghosh's tale, set in a remote sector of India. Bamji invests most of his resources into the rich, ringing cadences of Kanai, the translator and intellectual at the heart of the book. Kanai, a striver looking to pull himself up by his bootstraps, possesses a certain comic charm, and Bamji embraces the role with panache. He also alternates smoothly between Kanai's dulcet tones and the flatness of Indian-American scientist Piyali, who encounters Kanai by chance when traveling to investigate Indian marine life. Ghosh's book evocatively imagines an India poised between past and present, and Bamji brings out the enormous range of voices clamoring for attention in this unfamiliar setting.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The Pastons began as peasant farmers, rose to the status of minor Norfolk gentry and strove mightily to improve their lot through the courts, business and marriage. In this multigenerational biography, Castor tells their story as a sweeping whole and allows readers to understand these people's mental world, one so alien to us and yet strikingly familiar in the most unexpected of ways. Much of their story revolves around the acquisition of land and how they tried (not always successfully) to keep it out of the hands of their sometimes violent neighbors. Castor, a history fellow at Cambridge University, nicely summarizes the complexities of 15th-century politics and culture without losing her momentum. Beautifully paced and splendidly retold, Castor's tale of one family trying to survive and thrive against the odds is popular history at its best. 8 pages of color photos, 1 map.(Apr. 11)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Amos Townsend is the male protagonist, a 40-ish preacher who counseled the late Alice Baker-Maloney as her frayed marriage degenerated into a fatal confrontation with her controlling husband, Jack. Amos remains tormented by his attraction to Alice and his inability to have prevented the tragedy. Meanwhile, bookish Langston Braverman has returned home after dropping out of her Ph.D. program following an affair with an academic colleague and subsequent nervous breakdown. The two clash after Langston's mother, AnnaLee, orders her to abandon her literary projects to care for Alice's two orphaned daughters; Amos accuses Langston of being unfit for the job when both girls continue to exhibit a bizarre variety of compulsive, religiously oriented behaviors. The girls' crisis continues to escalate, leading to a series of melodramatic scenes in which Amos and Langston are forced to confront their own demons. There are some winning moments as the protagonists move toward a romance, although things are hindered somewhat by the sluggish pace in the early going, as Kimmel (A Girl Named Zippy) meanders through scenes detailing smalltown Midwestern life and as she delves into the pasts of the two leads. Still, she proves a wise, compassionate and often very witty storyteller whose affection for her characters is contagious.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an alternatePaperbackedition."

    "output": "In his lively history,Evening in the Palace of Reason, James R. Gaines sets two remarkable--and remarkably different--historical figures on a collision course toward a single night in Potsdam in 1747: the composer Johann Sebastian Bach--\"old Bach,\" as he was called then at the age of 62--and the still-young Prussian king, Frederick II, already known as Frederick the Great after less than a decade on the throne. Having long employed old Bach's son Carl--a more celebrated composer at the time--Frederick summoned the father from Leipzig and challenged him, with an offhanded cruelty, to a public compositional puzzle designed to humiliate the great wizard of the waning art of counterpoint.Gaines is a pleasant guide through the incestuous patchwork monarchies of middle Europe, with a breezy tone fitting for a former editor ofPeople. (\"The Hohenzollerns were a funny bunch,\" he writes at one point.) But he is also a passionately learned student of the intricacies of the era's musical theories and the secret languages of its coded compositions. (One is thankful that he and his publisher resisted calling the bookThe Bach Code.) Gaines leads up to his pivotal encounter with a double biography of his two principals, told in alternating chapters. Bach's mostly homebound life, which left few documents for historians, is often no match for the grotesque dramas of Frederick's parallel story, which climaxes when his father the king forces Frederick to witness the execution of his best friend (and perhaps lover). The weight that keeps the two stories in balance is the genius of Bach's work, particularly the masterfulMusical Offeringthat he composes in response to the king's challenge. The encounter itself may not bear the full burden that Gaines wants to give it, as a clash between two epochal worldviews, the faith of the Reformation versus the rationalism of the Enlightenment, but the two life stories he so vividly describes make the journey there more than worthwhile.--Tom Nissley"

Percy takes so long to complete his tasks, however, that the creatures fall asleep on a lion-shaped bench, and Percy plays a trick on them instead. It turns out that the joke is on all of them, though?the well-meaning squirrel has collected all the string, and they will have a difficult time finding their way out.

Beyond those facts, historical opinion varies--some scholars regard him as a reformer, and others as a reactionary, a debate that inspirits Michael Turner'sPittthe Younger (2003). Hague's biography differs from Turner's by muting interpretive issues and amplifying the day-to-day events in a life permeated by politics. Pitt's personal life remains enigmatic, and Hague acknowledges Pitt's elusiveness even as he attempts to ascertain whether he was an alcoholic or a homosexual. More certain is Pitt's ability as a leader and orator of the House of Commons, an institution the author himself knows well; he was the Conservative Party's former debating antagonist of Labour leader Tony Blair. Hague's experience adds convincing power to his account of Pitt's career, explaining how he remained ascendant for so long. A thorough biography, Hague's work is also an able contribution to British parliamentary history.Gilbert TaylorCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

Sanity, he notes, \"has never been a popular word, or indeed... a condition one might write a book about.\" Madness, on the other hand, is dramatic and all too visible. We have psychiatrists, neurologists and researchers dedicated to studying and treating madness, but not even a quantifiable definition of saneness. Deftly guiding readers through historical and literary uses of \"sane\" and \"mad,\" Phillips, a British psychoanalyst (On Flirtation), cites Thomas Carlyle, R.D. Laing, Melanie Klein, D.W. Winnicott and Richard Dawkins, among others, to illustrate the stark absence of a definitive definition of sanity. InHamlet, for instance, Polonius uses the word \"madness\" to describe Hamlet's inventiveness and eloquent intelligence: he admires Hamlet's madness. Phillips examines the presence and essence of madness in all aspects of modern life in intriguing and disturbingly frank chapters on the chaos of raising children, the turmoil of adolescence, sexual appetites and the pursuit of wealth. His arguments, both thought provoking and provocative, may affect future definitions of sanity and madness, and readers are left with a fresh awareness of what it really means to be sane.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Threaded into her family's crisis is her ongoing internal elegy on the exclusion of women from the literary canon, which she transposes to mean her daughter's exclusion from humanity. Reta wonders if her daughter has discovered, as she herself did years before, that the world is \"an endless series of obstacles, an alignment of locked doors,\" and has chosen to pursue the one thing that doesn't require power or a voice: goodness.In her own writing, Reta reaffirms her own sense of self, as well as her sense of humor. As her theoretical reflections on modern womanhood play counterpoint to her unwavering sense of creating a home and keeping her family together, Reta's smarts and fears form a wonderfully coherent narrative--a life worth reading about.

Still, he is unable to avoid the eternal question of \"what if?\" His mind wanders off medicare and HMOs, drifting back to his high school years, yearning for another chance to correct his juvenile mistakes, to chart a different course in life. Change, however, is thrust upon him when Sam, his lover of 15 years, leaves him for a younger man. Lingeman's world implodes, and he is thrown back into the scene of Washington's gay bars, seeking reaffirmation and companionship. His sudden change of status propels him into an obsession with one of his boyhood fantasies, a model in an ad he saw in a magazine as a child. Lingeman is so engrossed by this ephemeral man that he misses a more obvious and tangible potential lover. Cleverly, Lingeman's career echoes his romantic life, as he finds himself disgusted with the opportunism and cynicism of Washington politics. Merlis's staccato style, stinging and insightful, puts the reader inside Lingeman's head as he treads the fine line between fantasy and reality, between the superficial and the meaningful. Merlis is able to move from describing a certain assistant's dress as one \"an organ grinder might have chosen for his monkey\" to the deepest contemplations of commitment, couplehood and the importance of candor. He creates a protagonist with broad appeal, proving beyond doubt that the personal is political and vice versa.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."

    "input": "",
    "output": "In 1895, Oscar Wilde was sentenced to two years of hard labor for \"committing acts of gross indecency with other male persons.\" Wilde's story became a cautionary tale for homosexuals in Victorian England; in the century since, he has come to be celebrated as a martyr of the gay struggle for recognition. This volume, with an introduction and commentary by Wilde's grandson, Holland, publishes for the first time the unabridged transcript of the first of the three infamous trials that resulted in Wilde's destruction. The irony, as Holland's introduction makes abundantly clear, is that Wilde courted his imprisonment, suing his inamorata's father, the Marquess Queensberry, John Douglass, for libel when Queensberry left a card for him at the Albemarle Club that read, \"For Oscar Wilde, posing sodomite.\" Wilde might have been best served by tearing up the card and forgetting it; instead, he pressed charges. But Wilde's riskiest step was treating the witness stand as a theatrical stage. When a prosecutor asked him if he had kissed a certain young man, Wilde joked, \"Oh no, never in my life. He was a peculiarly plain boy.\" With that one flippant comment, Holland's text suggests, the die was cast. But the transcript and Holland's judicious notes also reveal how ill-served Wilde was by his counsel. Some of the same letters that were later used to convict Wilde were introduced by his own lawyers in this first trial as evidence. The general reader might find a work that condenses all three trial transcripts into one narrative, such as Moises Kaufman's stage adaptation, Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde, more accessible, but this volume is invaluable for the Wilde enthusiast, the legal scholar, the champion of human rights and the student of English literature.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc."

    "output": "A baffling array of science books claim to reveal how the mysteries of the universe have been discovered, but Simon Singh'sBig Bangactually delivers on that promise. General readers will find it to be among the very best books dealing with cosmology, because Singh follows the same plan he used in his brilliantCode Book: he puts people--not equations--first in the story. By linking the progression of the Big Bang theory with the scientists who built it up bit by bit, Singh also uncovers an important truth about how such ideas grow.Death is an essential element in the progress of science, since it takes care of conservative scientists of a previous generation reluctant to let go of an old, fallacious theory and embrace a new and accurate one.As harsh as this statement seems, even Einstein defended an outmoded idea about the universe when an unknown interloper published equations challenging the great man. Einstein didn't have to die for cosmology to move forward (he reluctantly apologized for being wrong), but stories like this one show how difficult it can sometimes be for new theories to take root. Fred Hoyle, who coined the term \"big bang\" as a way to ridicule the idea of a universe expanding from some tiny origin point, strongly believed that the cosmos was in a steady state. But Singh shows how Hoyle's research, meant to prove the contrary, added evidence to the expansion model.Big Bangis also a history of astronomical observation, describing the development of new telescopes that were crucial to the development of cosmology. Handwritten summary notes at the end of each long chapter add a charming, classroom feel to this revealing and very readable book.--Therese Littleton--This text refers to theHardcoveredition."

Green leaves trap sunlight and use it to absorb carbon dioxide from the air and emit life-giving oxygen in its place. Indeed, plants likely created Earth's life-friendly oxygen- and nitrogen-rich biosphere. In the first part, Morton, chief news and features editor of the leading science journal,Nature, traces scientists' quest to understand how photosynthesis works at the molecular level. In part two, Morton addresses evidence of how plants may have kick-started the complex life cycle on Earth. The book's final part considers photosynthesis in relation to global warming, for, he says, the Earth's plant-based balance of carbon dioxide and oxygen is broken: in burning vast amounts of fossil fuels, we are emitting more carbon dioxide than the plants can absorb. But Morton also explores the possibility that our understanding of photosynthesis might be harnessed to regain that balance. Readers should persevere through (or skim) the more technical discussions in the first part, for what follows is a vast, elegant synthesis of biology, physics and environmental science that can inform our discussions of urgent issues.(Nov. 4)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The author, who has studied and written about what she calls \"high sensitivity\" (The Highly Sensitive Person), states that this is a personality trait that occurs in 15% to 20% of the population. Although HSCs tend to be \"empathetic, smart, intuitive, careful and conscientious,\" they are also easily overstimulated and require informed parenting in order to prevent temper tantrums, stress illnesses and the avoidance of pleasurable group activities. Aron offers helpful advice that will assist both nonsensitive and highly sensitive parents through all stages of their child's development from infancy to adolescence. For example, since HSCs have great difficulty with change, it is necessary to prepare them gently so that they do not feel powerless during transitions. According to the author, there are four basic strategies that will help an HSC to become a happy adult: parents should foster their child's self-esteem, try to reduce the feelings of shame HSCs may develop because they are different, employ only mild positive discipline and learn how to talk positively to teachers and friends about their HSC so that interactions will be productive.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an alternatePaperbackedition."

Here 12-year-old Zeinab is given by her father to Napoleon in a Muslim marriage that is never consummated and later finds brief happiness in a marriage with chief engineer Nicolas Conte of the French Scientific Commission. Disavowed by her father, she is saved from being executed for treason by her pregnancy, then sheltered by the aristocratic philanthropist Sitt Nafisa the White. Serageldin recounts the devastation wrought on her home country by its successively more abusive occupiers&#x2014;the French, followed by the Turks and Albanians, who executed the leaders of the long-prominent Mamluke military caste&#x2014;in the context of the politics of the times. Through this plausible account of what Zeinab&#x2019;s life might have been, Serageldin opens a window on a tumultuous period in Egyptian history. --Michele Leber"

    "input": "",
    "output": "In this lively chronicle, historian Francis (Transcendental Utopias) offers a compelling portrait of the decline of Puritan ways in the late 17th century and the ascent of a secular spirit in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Although devout, Samuel Sewall (1652&ndash;1730) turned away from an early religious vocation to pursue a career in public office and married into the colony's aristocracy. He found himself catapulted into the limelight as one of nine judges who condemned the alleged witches of Salem in 1692. Francis calls this the turning point in Sewall's life and work. Never convinced that the condemned women were guilty, Sewall felt remorse; in 1697 he walked into a Boston church and offered a public apology, the only one of the three judges to do so. As a result, he was rebuffed by his social circle. Yet, according to Francis, Sewall's courage is magnified by his taking a stand he knew would result in ostracism. In his later years, Sewall wrote tracts opposing the colonists' treatment of Indians and slaves. Francis beautifully captures not only Sewall's personality and significance but also the shifting times in which he lived, when it was becoming no longer possible to \"see the world as a simple allegorical struggle between... good and evil.\" B&amp;w illus.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

    "output": "Those who fear the dry and impenetrable prose of many political essays need have no such reservations with this selection. Indian author Roy (The God of Small Things) brings a novelistic readability and immediacy to her impassioned critiques of imperialism, the corporate media and their \"neo-liberal project\"&#x97;what she describes as \"the medium of those who have power and money.\" Her unequivocally critical look at the Bush administration&#x92;s policy in Iraq will likely lead American readers to label her as either brilliantly astute or strongly anti-American. Still, she carefully differentiates between governments and their people. In \"Instant Mix Imperial Democracy,\" she congratulates Americans for standing up to their government: \"Hundreds of thousands of you have survived the relentless propaganda you have been subjected to, and are actively fighting your own government. In the ultra-patriotic climate that prevails in the United States, that&#x92;s as brave as any Iraqi or Afghan or Palestinian fighting for his or her Homeland.\" In the same talk, Roy delivers a scathing critique of the current state of democracy: \"The project of corporate globalization has cracked the code of democracy. Free elections, a free press and an independent judiciary mean little when the free market has reduced them to commodities on sale to the highest bidder.\" In addition to observing problems; Roy suggests non-violent solutions&#x97;boycotts, protests and open discussion. Regardless of whether one agrees with her ideas, Roy crafts articulate and convincing arguments that deserve their place in any debate on globalization, democracy or Iraq.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

    "input": "",
    "output": "This sprawling conspiracy theory traces the influence of ancient Egyptian and gnostic ideologies concerning a dualistic, Manichean cosmos prefiguring the earthly order, knowable only through secret, magical lore from medieval Catharism to the French vogue for pharaonic monuments and deities, the astrologically suggestive layouts of Paris and Washington, and the Statue of Liberty (the \"Isis of New York\"). The conventional explanation for the historical recurrence of gnostic themes and Egyptian iconography&mdash;that people peruse old texts and art works and adapt their ideas and symbols to new purposes&mdash;strikes Hancock and Bauval (coauthors ofKeeper of Genesis) as inadequate. They discern the millennia-long plot of a shadowy gnostic \"Organization\" working through usual suspects like the Freemasons, whose hidden hand they see influencing everything from the French Revolution to the founding of Israel. The authors draw eye-glazing webs of connections between historical coincidences&mdash;some intriguing, others tenuous and forced&mdash;to insinuate a \"not altogether impossible\" master plan. But their proposed conspiracy never gels. Its guiding philosophies, Christian gnosticism and pagan occultism, don't really mesh, and its agenda seems no more coherent than a perennial opposition to the alleged intolerance and obscurantism of the Catholic Church. The book's crude anticlericalism and conviction that culture propagates by conspiratorial, not intellectual, processes make it a distortion of the gnostic mindset.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

    "output": "Clevenger's debut novel is a well-crafted but underplotted character study of a brilliant, damaged man who struggles with mental illness and substance abuse as he bounces in and out of prison and a series of hospitals around Los Angeles. Most of the novel takes place in the latter setting; some tense early scenes pit protagonist John Dolan Vincent against a psychiatrist known as \"The Evaluator,\" who probes Vincent's psyche to see if his recent overdose of muscle relaxants was really a botched attempt to cure his migraine, as Vincent claims, or a suicide attempt. The twist is that Vincent has checked into the hospital under an assumed name; after each of his previous overdoses he has changed his identity to avoid being placed in a mental hospital. The psychiatric interview provides a decent vehicle for telling the story of Vincent's difficult family life and his decision to use his mathematical talent to assist a murky criminal network. The trouble is that Clevenger has little to offer to push his story forward besides Vincent's efforts to protect Keadra, the woman he falls in love with during a hospital stint, from the thugs who are trying to track him down. Clevenger is a solid writer who does some good work when it comes to creating a noirish atmosphere and smart, compelling characters, but the pace is uneven at best. The quality of the writing warrants a follow-up effort; hopefully, Clevenger will know what to do with his characters the next time around.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."

But within a few pages, these details, however vividly rendered, melt into the background of a larger, more compelling story of a joyless family. Fifteen-year-old Kambili is the dutiful and self-effacing daughter of a rich man, a religious fanatic and domestic tyrant whose public image is of a politically courageous newspaper publisher and philanthropist. No one in Papa's ancestral village, where he is titled \"Omelora\" (One Who Does For the Community), knows why Kambili&#xB9;s brother cannot move one of his fingers, nor why her mother keeps losing her pregnancies.

Macintyre's arrest ignites public sentiment against the police, stifling the investigation. Meanwhile, a second case drags MacRae into the local s&amp;m scene, where he gets an unexpected education in the sordid details from his red-faced assistant constable, and then he has to track down an eight-year-old killer. The one thing the three cases have in common is that nothing is what it seems.

In between $400-per-hour quickies at exclusive hotels, Nancy and her happy hooker pals Jasmine and Allison attend sex-industry activist meetings and debate the sinister reappearance of Jack, a former john who now appears to be obsessed with Allison. Nancy whines about this and her deepening relationship with her commitment-minded boyfriend to her shrink, also revealing how she plunged into prostitution as a teen.

Having seduced a silly Austrian princess on the ship bearing the body of Maximilian, the ill-fated emperor of Mexico, back home to Trieste in 1867, Harry eludes the offended Austrian authorities by seizing the chance to become the British envoy on a mission to rescue a group of European hostages held by the mad Abyssinian king, Theodore. (When Whitehall neglected to respond to the polite letter Theodore wrote Queen Victoria, he took captive a few hundred unfortunate foreigners.) This now obscure expedition, which made headlines in its day, provides the kind of sardonic history lesson fans have come to relish. Allusions to adventures not yet published tantalize, notably those to do with Flashman's role in the U.S. Civil War.

Chapters--or sections within the chapters--includeA-Zentries that range from a few paragraphs to a few pages. An extensive bibliography and a list of Internet resources complete the work.Illes focuses most strongly on Western European witchcraft practice and history, but she gives considerable attention to Asian, African, Mesoamerican, Caribbean, and South American practice as well. The creative arts chapter is up-to-date enough to discuss the Harry Potter phenomenon as well as many films, television programs, and other arts-related representations. Illes' take on the representation of witches inThe Wizard of Ozis in solidarity with witch practice.The book is long and could have used editing both to trim the text and to correct errors in spelling and grammar. Illes tends to overwrite when she feels passionately, and an editor would have helped with this as well. The horrors of witch persecutions--which continue in many places to this day--do not require overwriting, as William Burns shows very well inWitch Hunts in Europe and America(Greenwood, 2003), which is not in the bibliography.Academic libraries with extensive witchcraft collections may wish to consider this volume if only for the bibliography.

He divides his findings into six main chapters representing the consequences of a one- to six-degree shift in temperature rise. More factual than hysterical and using accessible language, the author portrays a sobering, but broad and fascinating, view of the problem. He discusses not only the environmental consequences of melting icecaps, ocean warming, coral reef bleaching, CO2 emissions, deforestation, and severe weather, but also cultural and economic reverberations-the result of population shifts, animal migrations, and societal collapse. Through computer-modeling simulations he looks back into the past (the Pliocene, the Mayan civilization) and projects into the future for CO2 comparisons. His premise: the problem is now at global scale and will not just impact the disappearance of one group alone as it did the Maya. Claiming that solutions must be political, and that it is too late for quick fixes using renewable energy sources or technology, he concludes with some cautionary possible solutions: relocalization of goods and services, less consumption, global-scale carbon rationing, and a \"2 degree increase target.\" Anyone studying climate change will find this a helpful reference as much current research has been precompiled and interpreted within one resource.&mdash;Jodi Mitchell, Berkeley Public Library, CACopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The Guardian  '!exceptional and necessary!Do not feel you have to be a leftist or liberal to read it, because it engages with an argument that it crucial for all of us, and for our time.' Christopher Hitchens, Sunday Times  '(He writes with) a genuine passion and human sympathy about people who have experienced appalling suffering.' Michael Burleigh, The Evening Standard  'Undoubtedly controversial and provocative \"What's Left?\" is, as its title suggests, a bleakly witty but perhaps dimly hopeful examination of what it means to be liberal in an age where the lines that have been drawn in the sand are in danger of being washed away.' Waterstones Books Quarterly  'One of the most powerful denunciations of the manner in which the Left has lost its way!Cohen's is a brave voice.' Michael Gove, The Spectator  'Nick Cohen explains how contemporary liberals have lost their way with his usual polemical brio.' The Observer  'An essay of wide reference and great brilliance.' John Lloyd, Financial Times  'Cohen skilfully shows how the left perversely set its moral compass by the United States!Cohen is at his best as a painstakingly forensic officer and he marshals his evidence with flair and rigour!He is at his very best when he exposes the dishonesty of the liberal press!Cohen's book has made me look with greater respect at the motives behind those who led the journey to war in Iraq in 2003, and view many of the anti-war campaigners with a new scepticism!This book is much more than a mere denunciation of old left-wing friends and colleagues. It is also a moving account of a long personal journey carried off with wit, verve, considerable literary skill and compassion.' The Observer  'It is an essay of wide reference and great brilliance, which flays every kind of foot-shuffling excuse for not facing up to the nature of the regime which that evil (and now, mercifully dead) tyrant, Saddam Hussein, inflicted on his country and planned for his region. Cohen surveys a gamut of liberal-left Western opinion that, in part under the pressure of the Iraqi war, has forgotten its best tradition and instead lapsed into its worst, that regards nothing as more important than the failures of its own societies, and that lacks the imagination or the will to comprehend the agonies of those living under tyranny.'

Proulx bought a 640-acre nature preserve by the North Platte River in Wyoming and started building her dream house, a project that took years and went hundreds of thousands of dollars over budget. In her bustling account, Proulx salivates over the prospect of a Japanese soak tub, polished concrete floor, solar panels, and luxe furnishings that often turn into pricey engineering fiascoes. The meticulous master builders she dubs the James Gang are the book's heroes. Though the house never quite lives up to its promise, it does inspire the author's engrossing natural history of the locale. Proulx drives cattle off of the overgrazed terrain; finds stone arrowheads; recounts the lore of the Indians, ranchers, and foppish big-game hunters who contested the land; and documents the antics of the eagles, magpies, mountain lions, and other critters who tolerate her presence. Like her fiction, Proulx's memoir flows from a memorable landscape where \"the sagebrush seems nearly black and beaten low by the ceaseless wind\"; the result is a fine evocation of place that becomes a meditation on the importance of a home, however harsh and evanescent.

She strides through centuries, past acres of novels, histories, biographies, and plays--even past Henry himself--confident in the knowledge that to recast history's most mercurial sovereign, it's not the King she needs to see, but one of the King's most mysterious agents. Enter Thomas Cromwell, a self-made man and remarkable polymath who ascends to the King's right hand. Rigorously pragmatic and forward-thinking, Cromwell has little interest in what motivates his Majesty, and although he makes way for Henry's marriage to the infamous Anne Boleyn, it's the future of a free England that he honors above all else and hopes to secure. Mantel plots with a sleight of hand, making full use of her masterful grasp on the facts without weighing down her prose. The opening cast of characters and family trees may give initial pause to some readers, but persevere: the witty, whip-smart lines volleying the action forward may convince you a short stay in the Tower of London might not be so bad... provided you could bring a copy ofWolf Hallalong. --Anne Bartholomew--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."

    "output": "Starred Review. Det. Sgt. Logan McRae, who's still recovering from the bloody events of 2008'sFlesh, investigates a series of brutal attacks on Polish immigrants in MacBride's excellent fifth novel to feature the Aberdeen, Scotland, cop. A local xenophobe, bitter about the influx of Polish workers, appears to be the culprit, but when one of the city's local crime bosses is assaulted, McRae begins to wonder if the violence is the result of a brewing turf war between Scottish crime figures and encroaching Eastern European thugs. Meanwhile, McRae and foul-mouthed Det. Insp. Roberta Steele are stuck babysitting Rory Simpson, a pedophile who becomes an inadvertent&mdash;but key&mdash;witness. MacBride's liberal use of humor, especially in the often slapstick rapport between McRae and the crusty Steel, never detracts from the action. A lesser writer would have fumbled such a complexly layered plot, but MacBride is in his element the more dark and twisted the story&mdash;and characters&mdash;become.(Oct.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.
